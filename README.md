# Syntax and Semantics &mdash; a Demonstration

An interactive demonstration of the difference between syntactic and semantic operations in computers, including a little puzzle at the end.  Currently online at [https://syntactic.netlify.app](https://syntactic.netlify.app/).

I just hacked this together for a philosophy of mind class I am teaching. The code is full of bad practices and is not very extendable.  Explore at own risk.

## Usage

Install parcel and run `npm start` to compile the webpage for distribution.

The code uses React and Styled Components.
